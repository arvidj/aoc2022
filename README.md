## Day 1

 - [bin/main_ex1_rec.ml](bin/main_ex1_rec.ml): A recursive version of day 1

### Running

```shell
dune exec bin/main_ex1.exe -- input_file.txt
```

Where `input_file.txt` follows the format described in Day 1, i.e. a
non-empty text file where each line is either empty or an integer, and
where the last and first lines are integer.
